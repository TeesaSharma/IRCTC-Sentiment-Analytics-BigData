fully fraud nothing good to say about this system and application just useless and money gobbler,0
doesnt open,0
bhai  din se log in nai ho rha hai thodi sharam krlo yaar hadd hai,0
very poor service even i cant create account,0
app has good ui however bit slow in payment processing while booking tatkal ticket even with wallet it keeps rotating unless all tickets are booked recently booke a tatkal ticket with wallet payment afterward train got cancelled and o got refund without wallet transaction charges it should be refunded fully as train cancellation was not due to mine fault,2
properly nahi chal raha hai,0
the worst app that is developed it asks for me to change my password once the otp is sent to my mail the moment i switch to mail and comes back the password reset page in the app is refreshed and asks again to change the password what a terrible app basically this process is now a never ending loop,0
good,2
the app is malfunctioning since last  days its not opening and everytime ive to uninstall and install to open it,0
very bad service,0
not able to log in on mobile app since  days complain not twitter n on the equery no solution yet  have to uninstall n reinstall to log in,0
third class railway,0
the app is not working properly every time it has some issues after the maintenance yesterday i faced login issues i had gotten less refund from irctc due to their technical glitches and site problems i was not able to cancel the ticket before due to the login issues in the application and website both i have contacted their support and query feature as well but no response even after sending mails or raising queries,0
i recently lost  while booking a train ticket on irctc the system showed available seats but after payment it became waiting list when i cancelled irctc deducted  per person  without ever telling me the refund rules clearly before booking as passengers we deserve transparency irctc should show all important details before payment like whether the ticket will be confirmed  rac  wl exact refund deduction in case of cancellation realistic confirmation chances,0
nothing works on this app,0
all the software engineers who made this app deserve a standing ovation this is what happens when engineering students dont study properly this app is a perfect example of that nowadays a class  standard student can code better app than this ridiculously buggy and poor ui app,0
why they dont have negative star marking worst app,0
good performance app,2
bhikari government ki gst vasoli  to ticket k dynamic charges uske uper convinient fees vo bhi gst k sath platroem fees means public ki earning ko lootne ka koi tarika baki nahi chodo or new new fees  tax add ker do pure rail staff ki fees bhi add ker do public ki pocket me kuch bhi  mat chodo sab kha lo in case railway jab khud train cancel kare to usme bhi refund pe gst please add  other convinient charges  gst there also ,0
i cant add money in wallet because the maximum amount is zero during tkt booking im always getting waiting list while payment it is showing ticket availability in double digit but after paying it takes  mins to show result as waiting list in double digit,0
app is lagging so much whenever i start the app and search for train booking the app lags and i have to restart the app for booking,0
worst application  doesnt run smoothly,0
very bad application,0
excellent updates daily,2
bakwas hai irctc payment kat ta hai or servar down,0
last night me and my wife travelled from kolhapur to mumbai in mahalaxmi express  s seat numbers   would like the authorities know that the toilets in this compartments both sides were very dirty many people especially ladies refused to use the toilet its the same story always the tiles stinks expecially when you have your seat at the entrance of the bogey the authorities should take note and keep the toilets clean,0
app not opening,0
worst performance very very disappointing,0
it is a useless app it keeps loading all the time sometimes this app does not work,0
the app does not open easily and it is buffering all the time especially these last two days,0
worst appwhat you can expect with the government app every time when i try to book a tatkal ticket it shows that this site is currently unreachable or unable to process requests ,0
not open after one day or two days use to irctc for login train confirm ticketvia pin no,2
very poor experience there is a prompt to change ones password when i switch to my mail to check the password screen refreshes making it impossible to change the password,0
worst ever,0
worst experience i was trying to authenticate aadhar from last  month and app keep saying error processing your request but when i tried from laptop the error was my name on aadhar was not matching with irctc account name even after knowing it i was not able to authenticate because i exhausted my aadhar authenticate requests why cant you just display error message on app properly just like website ,0
very helpful app,2
this app is best than other app,2
very poor app most of the time not loading after validating pin stage poor response from customer care,0
you can never book tatkal tickets from this app application server gets overloaded and error message appears on screen during tatkal booking time application of no use,0
after a long time irctc has created a new history they have there own problem centre now this time they a new one  there seems to be a connection issue with your request  please try after some time one more issue is ip address  dalal se earning he karni hai toh app mtt banao na,0
one can never book a tatkal ticket from this app even after verifying my aadhar i am not able to book tatkal ticket money will be deducted from account but the app will show nothing after few minutes it says your session expired it happens every time they will take your money and return it after  to  days you dont get your ticket  your money will get stuck for  to  days if you cant give tatkal ticket why even bother to give us the option for tatkal booking,0
bhangar application,0
useless app,0
very poor app for e ticketingduring tatkal hour booking is not possible than what is the need of this app now the time is came to completely privatised the ticket booking process after complete privatisation of ticketing process it becomes easy for everyone,0
worst app ever keeps logging out again and again during tatkal booking payment fails shows ip blocked and money gets deducted but no ticket booked takes  mins for one ticket always goes to waiting list horrible experience useless app needs serious fixing ,0
worst app,0
worst app ever seen,0
its fabricated,0
irctc interface very bad and ticket booking  month waiting waiting waiting,0
very bad experience this is all the fault of the railway people india has progressed so much in development still these people deliberately spoil their server improve it while booking tatkal ticket they are logout this is very wrong for us middle class people ,0
fix your serverwrost app,0
not working asking password change again and again very bad experiance,0
very useful for booking tickets and checking status,2
verryyy worst server ever i have been seen worst appp,0
now it is not even logging in pathetic app,0
biometric opp not available now login problem from last one month all time sow validating pin,0
take too much time for login every time the cache cleared required,0
always server unavailable disgusting app,0
does not work,0
the worst ui the worst experience you guys should get your app developed from a professional not a freelancer edit after  yrs  still the same thing the worst app in the world award goes to irctc rail connect kudos you have kept the spot unchanged for many years,0
dont use cheap software engineer,0
edit if there was an option for a star lower than  i would give that first of all i hate the tatkal system the tatkal system is so good that an error message keeps popping up saying i have a connection error but my wifi even with a speed of mbps cant help getting a tatkal ticket but the ads keep running how nice irctc i spam the next button only to see another pop up saying unable to identify client requests and logs me out adhaar link for stealing passenger data and display ads,0
good application,0
good,2
application not open many time,0
good,2
irctc app is not working nor is the booking facility correct,0
why not open this site app,0
nothing can be worse than this never install dont they have an option to give minus five stars as rating,0
very poor app when i book taktal ticket app shows unable to request page very bad  very poor app  it immediately kickout from app,0
totally frustrating  i tried multiple times to book a tatkal ticket but every time app crash and logout my id,0
this is disgusting the password or username is not matching or when i forgot or change the password its proper not change and give phone number reason or email reason extra extra,0
cancel ticket option not show,0
not working properly,0
vulnerable to use,0
i tried to login but didnt there was no error shown on the page every time login issue even finger print authentication successful,1
ye app kalse open kyu nahi ho rha every time i am trying to login it always says processing and failed,0
useless aap and people,0
reservation made easy kudos to indian railways thanks a lot irctc,2
from last  days i am trying to cancel my online ticket but not able to login app not working,0
irctc aap work is not properly,0
its keep on loading,0
i unable to login after update the app,0
tatkal ticket never gets booking app always hang shows error,0
its the most pathetic government app its so exploiting in nature problem is in their server and we have to suffer almost always,0
app updated on  november  but regret to say that after update its not working what is the use of this app if it didnt work when required earlier version was good and smooth function but its worse today it didnt open when i require d to book a ticket,0
best,2
this app instead of improvement the operating functions are very poor now a days once you open you have to refresh for checking the seat availability and fare and most of the time we get the message the app is not responding i have written the above message long back but no improvement,0
since one week unable to access my irctc rail connect app provides everything whatever is required but the app keeps waiting time too much dont whats the issue with app or any kind of bug or malfunction of the i hope this issue short it out soon i request the responsibility of team please look into this issue and solve it asap,1
bad net work,0
not  response,0
what a waste app unable to authenticate my adhaar and the population of the country sucks like you cant even have  minutes for booking tickets cuz all will get sold out,0
worst techs bugs and glitches everytime,0
grate applications everything is good like booking  all but tatkal booking system is mustly have to more helpful by not lagging on the time railway have to add an option for ordering food directly from pantry as per pnr no given,2
the app has become increasingly unreliable lately showing various errors that were never encountered before its especially disappointing during tatkal bookings where it often logs out unexpectedly and takes an unusually long time to confirm tickets after payment the developers should personally try booking a tatkal ticket through this app to truly understand the challenges users are facing,0
super,2
i am not able to login to the irctc app from the last  days onwards i tried uninstall and reinstall again but no lucky please fix the problem,0
super,2
buggy after latest update,0
when booking tatkal tickets you are prompted to log in and there are a lot of problems booking tatkal tickets,1
worst service high speed internet connection still keeps circling unable to do adhar authentication show some sincerity railway walon,0
facing login issue after entering password stuck at validating pin and wont login have to clear cache everytime to login the worst app ever,0

too much advertisement and more time show data not retrive again try and again try,0
bad service ,0
no mobile number change option so i couldnt use,0
login issue,0
booking tatkal tickets from irctc is a very bad option when you go to book a ticket it shows a lot of tickets even after the payment is done within  minute the app keeps buffing and the ticket gets booked waiting  and if the waiting ticket is not confirmed still your money is not refunded in full in such a situation irctc will deliberately make the waiting list very long and even for the waiting ticket which cannot be confirmedthis is a fraud with the user,0
worlds jhantu railway rule for booking tickets  even your children are booked apart from ur family ,0
one of the worst app,0
the app has suddenly slowed down unable to even log in,0
i find this apps core features useful but i must flag two major areas for improvement especially given its a train booking app first the performance is noticeably slow the lag when searching for train availability or loading the final booking pages is a critical flaw that needs immediate attention second please consider adding regional language support,0
one of the worest app i am booking ticket from last week takkal quota i am not getting only that too same time same train i have the proof if amount debited ticket is not available if money debited ticket is in waiting as soon as you open at  pm they will throught u out of the app now what is the value of addhar card verification done no value scam scam please reply,0

worst ever,0
app stuck in train search screen suddenly this is happening not able to book a ticket,0
pathetic app takes a life time to login every time have to uninstall and reinstall to login wish there was an alternative app that can end the monopoly of irctc,0
 of the time the app gets stuck at validating pin these days,0
best but always one problem faced unable to transaction etc,2
auto logout and not able to log in again,0
app is super glitchy wont open most of the time and reinstalling only works temporarily booking process is painfully slow even with good signal couldnt complete transactions multiple times due to slowness earlier it was much smoother and faster needs a lot of improvement,0

worst app cant even login in general timings,0
many new issues  it seems that they have now made some shady deal with makemytrip where irctc now shows waiting list for seats of vande bharat train even many days in advance but same tickets are available on mmt for double the price this is for tickets numbering in  not some small number of tickets according to me this is fraud with the general public  irctc app has stopped showing the option for no meal and forces one to choose between veg or non veg meal,0

you should have  login for airline ticket and tourism as well why do we have to down a separate app for each service more over it does not have a round trip booking option for rail tickets it does not tell you the features and benefits that are available on a particular train so if you could add that it will be great you call center number does not get connected at all it always says busy so you need to enhance that get a better developer for this is  grow up,0

starts dysfunctioning whenever i try to book tatkal,0
cant believe it is the official irctc app handled by goi they should have invested some money and tech in the app the app is so glitchy and slow cant book my tickets properly on time on this app,0
frequent changes in the policy why do we need to update the adhaar and pan details every time we try to book this is adding extra steps while booking with the new rules of  days limit of ticket booking its always full and to book tatkal these additional steps always create problem and finally by the time you reach to the main page of booking tickets are already gone,0

this app is horrendous during diwali ticket booking i tried booking for godan express  or  it appears all the ticket gets pre booked within  seconds of reservation opening though i tried booking at sharp  am i was not able to get one ticket too as it seems its just a formality to show the seats are available and everything gets booked in less than  seconds and the common man never gets the ticket in such trains its all suspicious which requires deep digging,0
from the last update it is not even logging in properly kindly notice the issue and rectify,0

this is absolutely pathetic i had to book tatkal tickets in an emergency and the application kept on showing the wrong user or password to the same google saved password that i always use finally blocking my id for a day when i needed it the most useless maintenance on top of that whats up with linking the adhaar for ac tiers being mandatory and unable to send the verification code to the number of tried linking it to the account  on maintenance ui and servers,0

the worst experience with irctc app because many times when you are booking ticketthe payment get debited from your account but ticket is not booked and the amount come in your account after  daysand even you cant do ticket booking againthere is rule you can book only one ticket between and we got trapped in irctc ticket booking system,0
worst app,0

the app is not allowing me to login whether i use captcha or login with otp the app takes an eternity just to check my credentials  and just keeps on rolling earlier it was a smooth experience but right now it is hell,0
this is not an app its baba sheer,0
in the irctc app when you use your wallet amount for booking the amount gets deducted instantly if the booking fails it takes around  working days to get the refund which is inconvenient also theres no option to transfer the wallet balance back to your bank account  customer care just says to use it for your next booking but i travel only once a year so the wallet money just stays unused there should be an option to withdraw or transfer it back,0
worst app while booking tatkal tickets it server goes down,0
not opening only validating pin is coming,0
before the tatkal ticket it crashes automatically,0
faltu system hua hai ab tatkal ticket nikalne ko mene wallet me balance add bhi kiya lekin ticket book karne time seat show hi nahi hui  min ke bad show hui to book karne gaya tab tak regret hogaya,0
