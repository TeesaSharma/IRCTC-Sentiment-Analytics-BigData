Only is accessible through OTP. 13/01/2023 Ridiculously useless app. Transaction fails regularly and almost always logs out automatically in 3-4 mins. Even if the app exists, it's safer to log in to your computer only to book tickets. Also, downloading ticket in pdf/jpg format is bad experience. Edit: Doesn't support UPI payment. Long pending issue.",1
